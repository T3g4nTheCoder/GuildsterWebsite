      Hello! First of all, welcome! My name is T3g4n and I have coded this
      absolutely amazing website! Anyway number 1, this is my about page so I
      better start saying some inspirational things about why I created this
      website. Anyway number 2, now that that's out of the way lets get into
      saying why I created this! Well, as you know, 2020 was
      <b>The very best year to ever year</b>; if thats actually a saying...
      Well, I am a 13 year old

      / gamer / athlete /
      <a href="https://youtube.com/T3g4n" class="aqua">youtuber</a> / streamer /
      etc. I only got into coding around 5 months into lockdown. I was very
      bored, watching
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com" class="aqua">Youtube</a> as you do, and
      it recommeded me a video from
      <a href="https://wornoffkeys.com" class="aqua">Worn Off Keys</a>. The
      thumbnail must have been good though, becuse I clicked on it and I guess I
      started trying it out. I don't remember the exact video because at the
      time of writing this I found that video around, I would like to say, 4
      months ago (around august 2020), but it was probably a pretty good one. I
      eventually started trying out my own code, but I only found luck with that
      around a month prior to writing this (November 2020). I'm now fairly good
      at coding discord bots and as you can see, terrible at html and css but
      I'm getting there. Hopefully I'll be good at css and html soon, because I
      honestly think that I am pretty good at designing things.
