        >Hello! First of all, welcome! My name is T3g4n and I have coded this
        absolutely amazing website! Anyway number 1, this is my about page so I
        better start saying some inspirational things about why I created this
        website. Anyway number 2, now that that's out of the way lets get into
        saying why I created this! Well, as you know, 2020 was
        <b>The very best year to ever year</b>; if thats actually a saying...
        Well, I am a 13 year old

        <a href="https://twitch.tv/T3g4n" class="aqua">streamer</a>
        / etc. I only got into coding around 5 months into lockdown. I was very
        bored, watching
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com" class="aqua">Youtube</a> as you do,
        and it recommeded me a video from
        <a href="https://wornoffkeys.com" class="aqua">Worn Off Keys</a>. The
        thumbnail must have been good though, becuse I clicked on it and I guess
        I started trying it out. I don't remember the exact video because at the
        time of writing this I found that video around, I would like to say, 4
        months ago (around august 2020), but it was probably a pretty good one.
        I eventually started trying out my own code, but I only found luck with
        that around a month prior to writing this (November 2020). I'm now
        fairly good at coding discord bots and as you can see, terrible at html
        and css but I'm getting there. Hopefully I'll be good at css and html
        soon, because I honestly think that (sometimes) I am pretty good at
        designing things.</a
